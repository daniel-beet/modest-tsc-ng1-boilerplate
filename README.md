# Modest Typescript-Angular 1.x Boilerplate

### Summary

- This boilerplate uses the typescript compiler to bundle files into a single file with AMD JS-modules. The bundle includes a small (1kb when minified) AMD API shim called [Almond](https://github.com/requirejs/almond). This approach in considerably faster than any Browserify or Webpack builds I've encountered.

- The boilerplate does also include the essential stylesheet and template related tasks you would except from a boilerplate. I tried not to bloat this repository too much, so the test runners, linting etc. are left out.
